#EGOAT - your new p2p client

Amazingly fast p2p client and server.


#TODO:

- test with bad peers (not really having a file or whatever)
    - blacklisting?
- add gui interface
    - what now?> with commands
    - something more elaborate as for example
        - ncurses
        - python clik
    - must have colors
- better management of  socket addresses
    - it would be nice if it was configurable, etc
