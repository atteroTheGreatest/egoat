#EGOAT - your new p2p client

Amazingly fast p2p client and server.


#TODO:

- test with bad peers (not really having a file or whatever)
- add tests
- refactor code
- add random choosing of peers
- add gui interface
- test files after download if they have the same checksum
- better management of  socket addresses?
