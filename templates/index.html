    <div class="well col-md-8">
        <p>Details of protocol are coming...</p>

        <p>Egoat has a simple protocol. First you have to find your peer and
        announce yourself to a server.</p>

        <p>Female goats are referred to as "does" or "nannies", intact males as "bucks" or "billies", and their offspring are "kids". Castrated males are "wethers". Goat meat from younger animals is called "kid" or cabrito (Spanish), and from older animals is simply known as "goat" or sometimes called chevon (French), or in some areas "mutton" (which more often refers to adult sheep meat)</p>
